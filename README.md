# Thinkpad-X250-Hackintosh

Two EFIs, one is for installation, one is for post-installation.

Not sure if the last one will work during installation, since I have no time to install the system again.

EFIs are based on zamkara/Lenovo-Thinkpad-X250-Hackintosh and olarila.

But one thing strange is that Mr Zamkara's EFI can not boot successfully, it stucks on Apple logo and middle of the progress bar.

Files maybe changed if I have more time on it.

All of these are for fun!

A real macbook doesn't cost a lot now!
